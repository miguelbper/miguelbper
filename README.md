### Hi!👋 I'm Miguel
- 🎓 I'm a PhD in mathematics ([here](https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/opus4/frontdoor/index/index/start/0/rows/20/sortfield/score/sortorder/desc/searchtype/simple/query/miguel+pereira+equivariant/docId/95736) is my thesis if you want to take a look)
- 👨‍💻️ I'm also interested in machine learning, algorithm design, and other CS topics
- 🐍 I usually code in Python (and Haskell, sometimes) and write with LaTeX
- 🤔 And I also enjoy trying to solve [brainteasers](https://github.com/miguelbper/jane-street-puzzles)
